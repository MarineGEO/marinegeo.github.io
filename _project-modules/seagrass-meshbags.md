## Overview
Seagrass meadows provide habitat structure and food, including production by associated algae, that support often dense and productive communities of small invertebrates and fishes. These small animals are key food resources for many fishes, especially juveniles, and seagrass meadows are thus important nursery habitats for harvested fish species in many regions. MarineGEO quantifies the small invertebrates (mobile epifauna) associated with seagrasses by collecting samples of seagrass and associated animals in the field, using fine-mesh bags, and then quantifying the abundance, biomass, and species composition of the collected epifauna in the lab.

## Measured Parameters
  - Epifaunal taxonomic composition
  - Epifaunal dry mass
  - Macroalgal dry mass
  - Seagrass dry mass (to standardize size of epifauna sample)
