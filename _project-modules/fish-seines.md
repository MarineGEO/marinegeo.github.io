## Overview
Subtidal habitats support an abundant and diverse community of animals, including [small invertebrate epifauna](https://marinegeo.github.io/modules/seagrass-meshbags), larger macroinvertebrates and fishes, and in some regions sea turtles and marine mammals (manatees and dugongs). Larger animals can play important roles in altering habitat structure, community structure, and ecosystem processes, and are key in transporting production from submersed habitats into other habitats. Furthermore, structured habitats like seagrasses serve as a key 'nursery' habitats for juveniles of many fish species and can thus support coastal fisheries.

Sampling large, mobile organisms in submersed habitats is challenging because of wide variation among regions in depth, water clarity, and physical setting. This protocol focuses on shallow, accessible subtidal or intertidal habitats like seagrass meadows and oyster reefs, where beach seines can provide a rapid, standardized and efficient way to sample smaller fishes. Seine sampling can be non-destructive when done carefully and efficiently, as animals are quickly returned to the water. Thus, seines provide a simple and useful tool for sampling fishes and mobile macroinvertebrates in a variety of habitat types.

In deeper areas with good visibility, [diver visual census](visual-census) provides an alternative to seining.
