## Overview
Seagrass habitats support an abundant and diverse community of animals, including [small invertebrate epifauna](https://marinegeo.github.io/modules/seagrass-meshbags), larger macroinvertebrates and fishes, and in some regions sea turtles and marine mammals (manatees and dugongs). Larger animals can play important roles in altering habitat structure, community structure, and ecosystem processes in seagrass beds, and are key in transporting production from seagrass meadows into other habitats. Furthermore, seagrass meadows serve as a key 'nursery' habitats for juveniles of many fish species and can thus support coastal fisheries. Sampling large, mobile organisms in seagrass beds is challenging because of wide variation among regions in depth, water clarity, and physical setting of seagrass meadows. This protocol focuses on shallow, accessible subtidal seagrass meadows, where beach seines provide a rapid, standardized and efficient way to sample smaller fishes. Sieve sampling can be non-destructive when done carefully and efficiently, as animals are quickly returned to the water. Thus, seines provide a simple and useful tool for sampling fishes and mobile macroinvertebrates in seagrass meadows. In deeper areas with good visibility, [diver visual census](fish-visual-census) provides an alternative to seining.
