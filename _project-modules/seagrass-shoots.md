## Overview
Most seagrasses grow as shoots, i.e., bundles of leaves, that emerge from an underground rhizome. The habitat structure and productivity of a seagrass meadow are a function of the density and lengths of shoots. This protocol measures these and other characteristics of seagrass shoots, along with the quantity of material growing on (fouling) them. 

### Measured Parameters
  - Blade length (mm)
  - Blade width (mm)
  - Sheath length (mm)
  - Disease lesions (number and length in mm)
  - Grazing scars (number)
  - Fouling biomass (mg)
