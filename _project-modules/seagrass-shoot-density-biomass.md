# Collect samples: Shoot density and above-ground biomass
*Goal: Collect samples for seagrass biomass and shoot density (N = 10)*
  1. For dense seagrass (>100 shoots/m<sup>2</sup>): Choose 10 haphazardly positioned points, ensuring that points are near, but >1 m away from, the transects to avoid destructive sampling within the transect.
  2.	At each point, carefully place the PVC ring (6 inch diameter) on the sediment surface to isolate shoots for collection. Be careful to collect only leaves from shoots rooted within the ring: if leaves are trapped inside the ring that originate from shoots outside the ring carefully remove them from the ring. Conversely, if leaves are trapped outside the ring that originate from shoots inside it, carefully pull these leaves back inside the ring.
  3.	Once the ring surrounds only leaves originating inside its boundary, collect all above-ground biomass (seagrass shoots and macroalgae) within the ring by pulling the shoots out of the sediment, and place all the shoots into a single sample bag.
  4.	Place an internal label in the bag, written in pencil on waterproof paper. Use the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass sample bags:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “veg” sample number
  - b.	Example:  PM 2016-06-23 veg 1 (where PM = Point Molate, California)
  5.	Place the sample bags in the cooler for transport to the lab.
  6.	For sparse seagrass (<100 shoots/mm<sup>2</sup>): If seagrass shoots are too sparse to be counted accurately in a core (say, <20 m<sup>2</sup>), shoot density can be quantified directly in the field by counting all shoots within an area appropriate for your site (e.g., 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat). You should still count the species under every point in the 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat as described here, including seagrass leaves.
