## Overview
Seagrasses support an abundant and diverse community of mobile species. These organisms can have substantial impacts on the community structure and function of seagrass beds, and are key in transporting energy out of these highly productive coastal areas. Furthermore, they serve as a key 'nursery' for juveniles of many species and thus indirectly support many coastal fisheries. Sampling mobile organisms in seagrass beds is challenging because the vast differences in the distribution of seagrass habitas, which range from intertidal to deep subtidal (>10 m). However, in shallow subtidal seagrass beds that are easily accessible, beach seines provide a rapid, standardized and efficient way to sample smaller mobile organisms, especially juveniles. They are also non-destructive and animals are quickly returned to the water. Thus, seines provide an ideal tool for sampling the higher levels of seagrass food webs.

(In deeper areas with good visibility, diver visual census provides an alternative to seining (link).)
