Squidpops are a simple, standardized assay for measuring the relative feeding intensity of generalist predators in aquatic systems. The assay consists of a 1.3-cm diameter disk of dried squid mantle tethered to a rod, which is either inserted in the sediment in soft-bottom habitats or secured to existing structure. Each replicate squidpop is scored as present or absent after 1 and 24 hours, and the data for analysis are proportions of replicate units consumed at each time. Tests in several habitats confirmed the assayâ€™s utility for measuring variation in predation intensity among habitats, among seasons, and along environmental gradients.

This protocol provides a simple, quick, standardized assay of fish predation intensity. When coupled with camera deployments, it can also be part of a Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) sampling of the fish community.

## Goals

  - Obtain quantitative, standardized estimates of predator feeding intensity;
  - Obtain quantitative, standardized estimates of fish abundance, size and species composition

## Requirements

**Personnel:** 2

**Time:** Preparation: 1 person x 2 hours. Field: 2 people x 2 days (roughly two half days, depending on travel time and field conditions). Data curation: 1 person x 1-2 hours.

**Frequency:** Variable (at least annually)
