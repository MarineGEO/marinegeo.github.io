# Collect samples: Fouling mass
*Goal: Collect seagrass fouling mass samples (N = 10)*
  1.	Choose 10 haphazardly positioned points, ensuring that points are near, but >1 m away from, the transects to avoid destructive sampling within the transect.
  2.	Collect one seagrass shoot at each point. Firmly grasp the shoot by the base, pull it gently from the sediment, and carefully place the shoot in a ziploc bag.
  3.	Place an internal label in the bag, written in pencil on waterproof paper. Use the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass fouling mass sample bags:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fouling” sample number
  - b.	Example: AB 2016-03-15 fouling 3 (where AB = Almirante Bay, Panama)
  4.	Place the sample bags in the cooler for transport to the lab.
