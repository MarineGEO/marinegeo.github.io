## Overview

The abiotic environment governs where and which species can occupy a given habitat. A number of methods exist for monitoring physical parameters such as temperature, salinity, and turbidity, including: continuously-monitoring sondes and loggers, instantaneous probes, and point measurements using physical equipment (eg, thermometers, refractometers, Secchi disks).

MarineGEO seeks to provide the tools to collect and inherit a variety of monitoring data. Here, you will find materials for reporting point measurements.

*If you have continuous data*, such as that from sondes or loggers, please contact us for further instructions.

## Measured parameters
  - Temperature (degrees Celsius)
  - Salinity (psu)
  - Turbidity (Secchi depth in m)
