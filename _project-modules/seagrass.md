## Purpose

Seagrasses provide critical habitat and a range of ecosystem services in coastal regions around the world. This protocol describes measurements to document the health of plant and animal components of seagrass ecosystems. MarineGEO sites complete the protocol at least annually during the peak season of biological activity, and preferably seasonally, to monitor seagrass community health and changes over time.     

## Measured Parameters:
 - Areal cover: Seagrasses, macroalgae, sessile macroinvertebrates
 - Seagrass shoot density
 - Seagrass leaf length and width
 - Seagrass above-ground biomass
 - Fouling mass on seagrass leaves
 - Mobile epifauna: species composition and abundance
 
## Requirements

**Personnel:** at least 3

**Time:** Field: 3 people x 8 hours. Lab sample processing: 3 people x 8 hours. lab: epifaunal sample sorting: ~30 person-hours.Data curation: 1 person x 1-2 hours.

**Frequency:** Annual (minimally), preferably seasonally

**Materials:** See detailed protocol

## Methods

The seagrass community assessment has two main components: (1) non-destructive assessments of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae), percent cover, and shoot density; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass shoot characteristics, fouling load, and epifaunal communities. The assessment is structured around three replicate 50 m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover and species composition are recorded within each of five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). Three types of samples are then collected at each quadrat (N = 15 each) and returned to the lab for processing: (1) a seagrass sample for measurement of seagrass leaf length, leaf width, sheath length, and foiuling load; and (2) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to characterize the associated mobile epifauna community. 

Please read the MarineGEO Seagrass Protocol for full methods and instructions.

## Data curation

Use the Seagrass Data Entry Template to transfer data from the field and lab data sheets into Excel and then submit data to <a href="mailto:marinegeo-data@si.edu">marinegeo-data@si.edu</a>.
