## Personnel

At least 3 people

## Time
3 people x 8 hours (field), 3 people x 8 hours (lab: sample processing), 30 person-hours (lab: epifaunal sample sorting)

## Frequency
Annual (minimally), preferably seasonally

## Rationale
Seagrasses provide critical habitat and a range of ecosystem services in coastal regions around the world. This protocol describes measurements to document the health of plant and animal components of seagrass ecosystems. MarineGEO sites complete the protocol at least annually during the peak season of biological activity, and preferably seasonally, to monitor seagrass community health and changes over time.     

## Sampling design
The seagrass community assessment has two main components: (1) non-destructive assessments of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae) and percent cover; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass biomass, fouling load, and epifaunal communities. The assessment is structured around three replicate 25 m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover and species composition are recorded within each of five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). Three types of samples are then collected (N = 10 each) and returned to the lab for processing: (1) a seagrass core for measurement of seagrass above-ground biomass, shoot density, and leaf length; (2) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to measure mass of fouling material; and (3) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to characterize associated the mobile epifauna community. See field and lab checklists at end of this document for required gear and supplies.

## Measured Parameters:
 - Areal cover: Seagrasses, macroalgae, sessile macroinvertebrates
 - Seagrass shoot density
 - Seagrass leaf length and width
 - Seagrass above-ground biomass
 - Fouling mass on seagrass leaves
 - Mobile epifauna: species composition and abundance
