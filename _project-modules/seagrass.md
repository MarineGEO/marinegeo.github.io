## Purpose

Seagrasses provide critical habitat and a range of ecosystem services in coastal regions around the world. For this reason seagrass extent and composition are considered Essential Ocean Variables. This protocol provides a standardized set of measurements for characterizing the changing structure and health of seagrass communities, including the cover and physical structure of seagrass canopy, fouling load, and community structure of the epifaunal communities that use seagrasses as habitat and are important conduits of productivity to fishes.     

## Measured Parameters:
 - Areal cover: Seagrasses, macroalgae, sessile macroinvertebrates
 - Seagrass shoot density
 - Seagrass leaf length, leaf width, and sheath length
 - Fouling mass on seagrass leaves
 - Mobile epifauna: species composition and abundance

## Requirements

**Personnel:** at least 3

**Time:** Field: 3 people x 8 hours. Lab sample processing: 3 people x 8 hours. lab: epifaunal sample sorting: ~30 person-hours.Data curation: 1 person x 1-2 hours.

**Frequency:** Annual (minimally), preferably seasonally

**Materials:** See detailed protocol

## Methods

Seagrass community sampling has two main components: (1) non-destructive measurements of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae), percent cover, and shoot density; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass structure, fouling load, and associated epifauna. The assessment is structured around three replicate 50-m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover, species composition, and seagrass shoot density (in a portion of the quadrat if shoots are very dense) are recorded within each of five 1 m2 quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). Three types of samples are then collected (N = 15 each) and returned to the lab for processing: (1) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to measure seagrass leaf length and width, sheath length, and mass of fouling material; and (2) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to characterize the associated mobile epifauna community.

Please read the MarineGEO Seagrass Protocol for full methods and instructions.
