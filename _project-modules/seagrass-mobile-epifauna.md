# Process samples: Mobile epifauna
*Goal: Preserve a sample of the mobile epifaunal community with data on the macrophytes with which it was associated. At the end of this procedure you should have 10 mobile epifauna samples and 10 associated seagrass samples from which the epifauna were collected.*
  1.	Print a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna. Fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as data recorder. Explain any abbreviations used.
  2.	In the lab, carefully transfer contents of the sample bag containing the mobile epifauna and associated seagrass into a large 0.5 mm-mesh sieve. Rinse the sample bag into the sieve, repeatedly if necessary, to ensure that all material from the sample is on the sieve.
  3.	Rinse the contents of the 0.5 mm sieve under a gentle stream of tap water to remove sediment and small debris from the sample.
  4.	Transfer the seagrass and associated animals from the sieve to a large, shallow sorting tray (white is best) filled with water. Rinse the sieve with a squirt bottle of water, repeatedly if necessary, to ensure that all material from the sample is transferred to the tray.
  5.	When all material has been removed from the sieve, rinse it thoroughly and then assemble a nested pair of sieves, with the 1 mm sieve on top and the 0.5 mm sieve below. This will be used in following steps to concentrate the epifauna.
  6.	Agitate the seagrass material in the tray of water for a minute or so to dislodge associated animals. Then pour the water and dislodged animals into the nested pair of sieves.
  7.	Carefully refill the tray with tap water, repeat the agitation of the seagrass sample, and pour the water with any remaining animals into the paired set of sieves. Repeat this step until few or no animals are left in the agitated water.
  8.	Carefully remove all seagrass, macroalgae, and sessile macroinvertebrates from the tray, checking to ensure that no mobile epifauna are clinging to the removed material. Set the removed material aside to be weighed in a later step.
  9.	Return to the nested pair of sieves, which should now contain all mobile epifauna from the sample.
  10.	Locate two 20-ml scintillation vials (preferably plastic) for storage of the mobile epifauna on the two sieves.
  11.	Carefully label each vial with both (1) an internal label, written firmly with pencil on water-proof paper, and (2) an external label, written with sharpie or, better yet, ethanol-resistant felt-tip pen. Check that the two labels for a given vial are identical and follow the MarineGEO convention for labeling mobile epifauna samples above, but with addition of the sieve size:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number, sieve
  - b.  Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6, 0.5 mm  
  12.	Carefully transfer the contents (mobile animals) of the 1-mm sieve to its appropriate labeled vial. This can be done by picking up the mass of small animals with a spatula or spoon, and transferring to the vial. The use a squirt bottle of water to concentrate remaining animals in the sieve, repeating as necessary. The final residue of animals can be washed carefully into the vial with a squirt bottle.
  13.	Remove as much water from the vial as possible, being careful to avoid removing any animals, then fill the vial about ¾ full with 70% EtOH.
  14.	Check to make sure that both internal and external labels are in place and identical.  
  15.	Repeat the last three steps for the contents of the 0.5-mm sieve.
  16.	In cases where the epifaunal sample is too big to fit in a single 20-ml vial, divide the collected animals into as many vials is necessary. Each vial should be assigned a unique subsample number as follows:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number-subsample number, sieve
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6-1, 0.5 mm  
  17. Record the unique label information of each vial on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna.
  18.	Store the sample in a secure, designated place for later identification and enumeration.  
  19.	Return to the seagrass biomass set aside after epifauna was removed to the sieves.
  20.	Prepare a labeled aluminum foil pack or tray for each species of seagrass, macroalga, or sessile macroinvertebrate for oven drying. Write a label for each clearly, using a dark sharpie or equivalent, on the foil pack using the MarineGEO convention for labeling mobile epifauna samples above, but with addition of the designation “[taxon]” and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number, “[taxon]”, tare
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6, Zostera, 0.786 g
  21.	Record the sample number and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna.
  22.	Place the biomass of seagrass, macroalga, or sessile invertebrate in its labeled aluminum pack.
  23.	Place the labeled foil packs containing the biomass samples in the drying oven at ~60°C and dry to constant weight (usually 1-3 days).
  24.	Once the samples have dried, remove the foil pack from the oven, weigh to nearest mg, and record the sample (including foil) dry mass on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna.
  25.	Review the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in, that numbers have appropriate units (g or mg, cm or mm) specified, and that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.  
  26.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  27.	After samples have been weighed, and before leaving the lab for the day, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name:  
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) fauna
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna


### Count and identify mobile epifauna
*Goal: Characterize species composition and abundance of mobile epifauna associated with seagrass.*
  1.	Print a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species. Fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as sample sorter. Explain any abbreviations used. Use a separate data sheet for each of the ten mobile epifauna samples.
  2.	Note: Normal MarineGEO protocol is to enumerate only those epifauna retained on the 1 mm sieve. We also exclude from the mobile epifauna category all primarily meiofaunal taxa, including nematodes, copepods, ostracods, and mites. If these are retained on the sieves they can be ignored.  
  3.	Empty the contents of the 20-ml vial containing the 1-mm sieve epifaunal sample into a 10 cm glass Petri dish or similar vessel for sorting. If the sample is large, begin with a portion of the sample, and repeat until the sample is completed.
  4.	Prepare the sample for photographic measurement of epifaunal body sizes: remove as much debris as possible and spread the animals out so they are separated on the bottom of the dish. If there are too many animals to separate clearly, return some to the vial to clear space.
  5.	Place a centimeter rule under or adjacent to the dish to provide a scale for measurement.
  6.	Take one or more digital photographs to capture all animals in the dish at sufficient resolution that their body sizes can later be measured from the image using the included scale. Photographs may be captured with a camera attached to the microscope or with a cell phone fitted with a macro lens.
  7.	Inspect the images to make sure they are sharp enough to measure body sizes of animals.
  8.	Once all animals in the sample have been photographed, it’s time to identify and count them. If you don't know the taxonomy well (and even if you do), it’s often easiest to separate the animals into groups by morphospecies.  
  9.	Count all individuals of a given (morpho)species. As you count them, remove them to a small vial with 70% ethanol and an internal label with the sample information (as above) and species name. If you cannot reliably identify the taxon to species, identify it to the lowest taxon that you feel confident in, and give it a provisional name, (e.g., Nereid polychaete A).  
  10.	Record the taxon name, provisional or otherwise, and the number of specimens on the MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species.
  11.	Note: Strive to keep as separate taxa that you suspect are different species, even if you don’t know their names. For example, if your sample contains two groups of amphipod specimens that you can't identify but you feel pretty confident are different species, you can call them amphipod A and amphipod B. This is better than lumping them together under “Unknown amphipods”.  
  12.	Note: It is better to be somewhat less precise in your identification (e.g., Amphipod A or Gammarus sp.) than to record an identification that you have significant doubts about (Gammarus mucronatus?). However it is helpful to make a note on the data sheet indicating your educated guess.  
  13.	Using the microscope or cell phone camera, record photographs of species you can't identify at the highest magnification where you can still achieve a sharp image. Label these images with the sample information and provisional species name you assigned on the data sheet.
  14.	Review the MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in and that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.
  15.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  16.	After the sample has been sorted, and before leaving the lab for the day, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name but with addition of “counts”:  
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number, sieve, “counts”
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6, 1.0 mm, counts
