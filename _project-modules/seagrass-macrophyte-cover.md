## Purpose

Seagrasses and other sessile macroorganisms provide key habitat for other anmals and algae in coastal regions throughout the world. This protocol quantifies, on a local scale (meters) the proportion of the sea bottom that is occupied by seagrasses, macroalgae and sessile invertebreates such as sponges. 

## Goal

  - Quantify species composition and areal cover of seagrasses and other sessile macroscopic organisms (macroalgae, sponges, etc.) 


## Requirements

**Personnel:** 2

**Time:** Field: 2 people x 2-3 hours. Data curation: 1 person x 1 hour.  

**Frequency:** At least annually

**Materials:** quadrat (1 m2) with monofilament lines forming at least 50 points, clipboards, pencils, field data sheet on underwater paper 	


## Methods

Seagrass community assessment in the MarineGEO program has two main components: (1) non-destructive assessments of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae) and percent cover, described in this protocol; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass biomass, fouling load, and epifaunal communities, described elsewhere. The assessment is structured around three replicate 25 m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover and species composition are recorded within each of five 1 m2 quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). 

Please read the MarineGEO Seagrass Cover Protocol (comng soon ...) for full methods and instructions.
