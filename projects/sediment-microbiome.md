## Overview

## Data Submission

## Expectations

Smithsonian MarineGEO commits to provide:

- coordination in the form of participant recruitment, planning fieldwork with each participant;
- standardized protocols and templates;
- data management; and
- data synthesis, and lead writing of the publications.

Each partner commits to:
- conducting the required field work;
- processing the samples collected;
- submitting the data in standard format to MarineGEO; and
- contributing to data interpretation and manuscript preparation.

MarineGEO further commits to preparing the first manuscript for peer-reviewed publication, with all co-authors, within one year of completion of fieldwork, and to making all data publicly available to participants by March of next year.
