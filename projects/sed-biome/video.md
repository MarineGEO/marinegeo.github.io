This four part video tutorial is meant to instruct MarineGEO SED-BIOME partners how to deploy and retrieve project materials from the field, and prepare laboratory samples to be analyzed. A video consisting of all four parts is available [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9B2DWw0PlQ)  

#### Part I: Unboxing Your Kit
The is part I of a four-part video tutorial for the MarineGEO Network Project, SED-BIOME. It details what our partners will find in their kits and also lists items not included in the package. We also demonstrate how to assemble the sediment traps.

#### Additional Video Resource: Tea Bag Frame Assembly  
This video tutorial is for our partners who have received packages without fertilizer or the fertilizer has been packaged separately and thus will have to disassemble and reassemble their experimental frames where the fertilizer is meant to be inside. The video details how to assemble the tea bag frames. It is very important to keep the orientation and position of the tea bags consistent as you disassemble and reassemble them.
