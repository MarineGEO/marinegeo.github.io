## Purpose
Fishes are not only important sources of food for people, they are also key “engineers” in marine ecosystems, potentially reducing establishment of invasive species and maintaining desirable habitats like reefs and seagrass beds in the face of overgrowth by algae. Although the ecological importance of such “top-down control” by predators is widely appreciated, it has not been measured systematically across a range of sites in marine waters. The Bitemap project aims to do so.

The structure and function of ecosystems is largely dictated by the types and productivity of plants that populate them. These characteristics are in turn set by the supply of resources and the intensity of consumption by animals, commonly called bottom-up and top-down forcing, respectively. Bottom-up control is relatively well understood, with primary production following straightforward theoretical and empirical relationships with temperature and the availability of light, water, and mineral nutrients. Vegetation can be mapped relatively easily, and as a result, remote sensing has yielded a picture of the distribution and biomass of primary producers at a level of detail unimaginable a few decades ago.

The geography of top-down control is much less well understood. Characterizing this variation in consumer pressure is important because evidence indicates that top-down control by predators tends to have stronger impacts and penetrates farther through the food web than does bottom-up control by resources. Yet predators are declining around the world, with often profound but poorly documented implications for ecosystem structure and function.

## About

Squidpops are a simple, standardized assayfor measuring the relative feeding intensity of generalist predators in aquatic systems. The assay consists of a 1.3-cm diameter disk of dried squid mantle tethered to a rod, which is either inserted in the sediment in soft-bottom habitats or secured to existing structure. Each replicate squidpop is scored as present or absent after 1 and 24 hours, and the data for analysis are proportions of replicate units consumed at each time. Tests in several habitats confirmed the assay’s utility for measuring variation in predation intensity among habitats, among seasons, and along environmental gradients. Quantitative visual surveys confirmed that assayed feeding intensity increased with abundance and species richness of fishes across sites,. Predation intensity varied seasonally, being highest during summer and declining in late autumn. Deployments in marsh habitats generally revealed a decline in mean predation intensity from fully marine to tidal freshwater sites..

## Goals

(1) Obtain quantitative, standardized estimates of predator feeding intensity;

(2) Obtain quantitative, standardized estimates of fish abundance, size and species composition


## Materials:

 - ~1 meter lengths of ¼ inch polypropylene rope (20)
 - Small rock or rubble to attach to one end of rope as weight (20)
 - Small (thumb-sized) pieces of neoprene or other buoyant material to attach to other end of rope to maintain vertical position. (20)
 - Small zip ties to attach neoprene to rope. (20)
 - 5 types of common macrophytes (20 of each):
 - Location dependent. Typically includes: a fleshy red alga, fleshy green alga, fleshy brown alga, calcareous red, seagrass blade. Pieces of algae should be about the size of a circle formed by your thumb and forefinger, blades of seagrass should be cut to ~7cm lengths.
 - Data Sheet

## Method:

1.	Attach rock or rubble to one end of each rope. Usually this can be done by gently pulling apart the twisted rope and inserting the rubble so it holds. You will have to make sure the ropes are either burned or taped at each end to prevent fraying. Curved coral rubble works very well as weight.
2.	Attach piece of neoprene to other end with zip tie.
3.	Haphazardly put one piece of each type of macrophyte between the twists of each rope so they are evenly distributed along the length of that rope. You should have all five macrophytes on each rope in haphazard orders (do not attached them in the same ordered position for each rope!)
a.	When you first start deploying these assays, or switch to a new species of macrophyte for your assay, you should weigh all the pieces of algae before deploying. I would recommend doing this for at least the first few deployments so you have a good idea of generally how much of each macrophyte you are putting on each rope.
4.	Keep the ropes in flow-through sea water until they are deployed and transport to the field in a bucket full of sea water.
5.	Deploy the ropes on snorkel or SCUBA within your target habitat type. They should be 1.5-2 meters apart from each other and can be deployed in a line, grid, or any other way that is convenient. I’ve found a line to be the easiest to count and retrieve.
6.	Leave them alone for one hour.
7.	After one hour, return and score each rope for missing macrophtyes using the data sheet. Each column is one of the macrophytes, each row is one of the ropes. I usually just put an ‘X’ in the box that corresponds to the macrophyte that is missing. You are scoring for presence/absence. We’ve found that if a macrophyte is going to be consumed, it will either still be there, or be completely gone. It looks like it is still mostly there, it is not scored as missing (with the ‘X’). Any bits that seem ‘borderline’, should be noted on the datasheet.
8.	Leave them alone for an addition 23 hours.
9.	Return after 24 hours from initial deployment, score all the ropes as at one hour, and retrieve the ropes.
10.	Enter your data in the computer as soon as possible! We will have a template soon for you to use for this, but for now use the guidance provided. Be sure to update the metadata tab where appropriate!
11.	Submit data to the MarineGEO data manager: <marinegeo-data@si.edu>.
