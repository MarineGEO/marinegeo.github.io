## Personnel

At least 3 people

## Time
3 people x 8 hours (field), 3 people x 8 hours (lab: sample processing), 30 person-hours (lab: epifaunal sample sorting)

## Frequency
Annual (minimally), preferably seasonally

## Rationale
Seagrasses provide critical habitat and a range of ecosystem services in coastal regions around the world. This protocol describes measurements to document the health of plant and animal components of seagrass ecosystems. MarineGEO sites complete the protocol at least annually during the peak season of biological activity, and preferably seasonally, to monitor seagrass community health and changes over time.     

## Sampling design
The seagrass community assessment has two main components: (1) non-destructive assessments of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae) and percent cover; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass biomass, fouling load, and epifaunal communities. The assessment is structured around three replicate 25 m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover and species composition are recorded within each of five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). Three types of samples are then collected (N = 10 each) and returned to the lab for processing: (1) a seagrass core for measurement of seagrass above-ground biomass, shoot density, and leaf length; (2) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to measure mass of fouling material; and (3) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to characterize associated the mobile epifauna community. See field and lab checklists at end of this document for required gear and supplies.

## Measured Parameters:
 - Areal cover: Seagrasses, macroalgae, sessile macroinvertebrates
 - Seagrass shoot density
 - Seagrass leaf length and width
 - Seagrass above-ground biomass
 - Fouling mass on seagrass leaves
 - Mobile epifauna: species composition and abundance

## Methods: Field sampling of seagrass communities

### Preparations prior to field work

*Goal: Ensure reliable field and lab operations and safety of staff and data*

 1. Designate a single team leader responsible for coordinating field and lab activities related to the seagrass sampling and data management.
 2.	Notify all participants in field and lab activities who the team leader is. Exchange cell phone and email information among all participants.
 3.	Designate a secure physical location for storage of samples (e.g., mobile epifauna vials) and completed data sheets.
 4.	Designate a secure location with informative folder structure for electronic files (scanned data sheets, field photos, etc.). Make sure all participants know these locations and that samples and data sheets are placed there safely at the end of each work day.


### Site selection and characterization

*Goal: Select 3 sites for long-term sampling of seagrass communities*

  1.	Seagrass sites for long-term monitoring should be selected for logistical ease of repeated access and representativeness of the region where possible.
  2.	Select three sites, ideally separated by at least 1 km. Seagrass cover should be as homogeneous as available at the site, and the meadow large enough that transects can be positioned at relatively constant depth. The following protocols describe the activities for one site, which should be repeated at the other two sites.
  3.	We recommend a discussion of site selection with MarineGEO team by phone or skype during exploration of potential sites.
  4.	Once a site has been selected, give it a name that will be used consistently in MarineGEO data collections.
  5.	Record the site’s GPS coordinates.
  6.	Capture some digital photographs to characterize site and seagrass characteristics.
  7.	Select locations to establish three permanent, 25-m transects and mark the ends with durable stakes, poles, or other markers. Transects should be marked “permanently” for repeated surveys. Destructive samples described below should be taken at least 1-2 m away from the permanent transects.
  8.	Print a copy of this protocol and bring it with the assembled gear (see checklist at the end of this document) to the field site when sampling.


### Measure macrophyte percent cover

*Goal: Record macrophyte species composition and areal cover (N = 15)*

  1.	Assemble necessary gear (see field checklist below) and a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet for percent cover. Upon arrival at field site fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as data recorder. Explain any abbreviations used.
  2.	Deploy three 25-m transects, separated by ~10 m, at as uniform a depth as possible within the seagrass meadow.
  3.	Drive a 1.5 m PVC pole into the sediment at the beginning and end of each transect to mark the sampling area. Record depth (relative to mean lower low water) and state of tide on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for percent cover. Poles or other more permanent markers may be left in the field if it is feasible to sample the same transects repeatedly over the long term and if this does not pose a safety hazard.
  4.	Along each transect, randomly select five points for quadrat surveys.
  5.	At each random point, place a PVC quadrat (1 m<sup>2</sup>) adjacent to the transect line. Identify the macrophyte species directly underneath each point (i.e., intersection of monofilament cross-lines), tally these up, and record on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for percent cover. It is often helpful to count one taxon at a time, sequentially (e.g., Zostera marina first, then Gracilaria sp., etc.). Count any point that covers vegetation, whether blade or shoot. Be sure to count the number of points over bare substratum also.
  6.	Before leaving the field review the MarineGEO standard datasheet for percent cover. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in, that numbers have appropriate units specified, that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.
  7.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  8.	Upon returning to the lab, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet for percent cover and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name:  
  - Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “cover”  
  - Example:  SB 2016-05-04 cover (where SB = South Bay, Virginia)

### Collect samples: Shoot density and above-ground biomass
*Goal: Collect samples for seagrass biomass and shoot density (N = 10)*
  1. For dense seagrass (>100 shoots/m<sup>2</sup>): Choose 10 haphazardly positioned points, ensuring that points are near, but >1 m away from, the transects to avoid destructive sampling within the transect.
  2.	At each point, carefully place the PVC ring (6 inch diameter) on the sediment surface to isolate shoots for collection. Be careful to collect only leaves from shoots rooted within the ring: if leaves are trapped inside the ring that originate from shoots outside the ring carefully remove them from the ring. Conversely, if leaves are trapped outside the ring that originate from shoots inside it, carefully pull these leaves back inside the ring.
  3.	Once the ring surrounds only leaves originating inside its boundary, collect all above-ground biomass (seagrass shoots and macroalgae) within the ring by pulling the shoots out of the sediment, and place all the shoots into a single sample bag.
  4.	Place an internal label in the bag, written in pencil on waterproof paper. Use the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass sample bags:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “veg” sample number
  - b.	Example:  PM 2016-06-23 veg 1 (where PM = Point Molate, California)
  5.	Place the sample bags in the cooler for transport to the lab.
  6.	For sparse seagrass (<100 shoots/mm<sup>2</sup>): If seagrass shoots are too sparse to be counted accurately in a core (say, <20 m<sup>2</sup>), shoot density can be quantified directly in the field by counting all shoots within an area appropriate for your site (e.g., 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat). You should still count the species under every point in the 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat as described here, including seagrass leaves.


### Collect samples: Fouling mass
*Goal: Collect seagrass fouling mass samples (N = 10)*
  1.	Choose 10 haphazardly positioned points, ensuring that points are near, but >1 m away from, the transects to avoid destructive sampling within the transect.
  2.	Collect one seagrass shoot at each point. Firmly grasp the shoot by the base, pull it gently from the sediment, and carefully place the shoot in a ziploc bag.
  3.	Place an internal label in the bag, written in pencil on waterproof paper. Use the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass fouling mass sample bags:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fouling” sample number
  - b.	Example: AB 2016-03-15 fouling 3 (where AB = Almirante Bay, Panama)
  4.	Place the sample bags in the cooler for transport to the lab.


### Collect samples: Mobile epifauna
*Goal: Collect mobile epifauna samples (N = 10)*
  1.	Choose 10 haphazardly positioned points, ensuring that points are near, but >1 m away from, the transects to avoid destructive sampling within the transect.
  2.	At each of the 10 sampling points, use a single ziploc or fine mesh bag to gently but quickly enclose a clump of seagrass shoots. Close the open bottom of the bag around the base of the seagrass shoots as best you can, cut the seagrass blades from underneath the mesh bag, and quickly close and secure the bag (zip it closed if ziploc, or use rope or cable tie for mesh bag) to capture detached seagrass blades and associated animals within. (Note: mesh bags allow water to escape for more compact sample transport, but some workers prefer ziplocs because animals  can cling to mesh and are difficult to remove.)
  3.	Place an internal label in the bag, written in pencil on waterproof paper. Use the MarineGEO convention for labeling epifauna sample bags:
  - a.	Convention: 	Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6 (where FP = Fort Pierce, Florida)
  4.	Place the sample bags in the cooler for transport to the lab.


## Methods: Lab processing of seagrass community samples

### Process samples: Shoot density and above-ground biomass  
*Goal: Measure seagrass biomass, shoot density, leaf length and width, and biomass of macroalgae and sessile invertebrates if present*

  1.	Print a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass. Fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as data recorder. Explain any abbreviations used.
  2.	In the lab, carefully transfer contents of the ziploc bag containing the biomass sample into a 1 mm-mesh sieve. Rinse the contents under a gentle stream of tap water to remove most sediment and debris from the seagrass.
  3.	Transfer the contents of the sieve to a large, shallow sorting tray (white is best).
  4.	Separate all macrophytes and sessile macroinvertebrates by species.
  5.	Record the total number of shoots of each seagrass species in the sample, using the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass.
  6.	For each seagrass shoot, select the longest leaf and measure length and width of the longest leaf to the nearest mm. If the sample contains more than 5 shoots, you need only measure longest leaf length and width for 5 shoots per sample. Record these measures on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass.
  7.	For seagrasses, separate above-ground biomass from any below-ground biomass by cutting the shoot where color changes from green to white/clear. Discard any below-ground material.
  8.	If the seagrass is heavily fouled with filamentous algae or sessile invertebrates, remove these as best you can with your fingers or a soft brush. Unless the seagrass is heavily fouled, it is not necessary to clean it thoroughly beyond the initial rinse step (as a rule of thumb, if the fouling mass is estimated to be < 5% of the seagrass mass, it can be ignored. If estimated to be >10%, clean it).
  9.	Prepare a labeled aluminum foil pack or tray for each species of seagrass, macroalga (if present), and sessile macroinvertebrate (if present) for oven drying. Write the label clearly, using a dark sharpie or equivalent, on the foil pack using the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass biomass samples above, but with addition of the taxon and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “veg” sample-number taxon tare
  - b.	Example:  PM 2016-06-23 veg 1 Zostera, 1.235 g
  10.	Record the sample number and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass.
  11.	Place the cleaned biomass of each species in its labeled aluminum pack.
  12.	Place the labeled foil packs containing the biomass samples in the drying oven at ~60°C and dry to constant weight (usually 1-3 days).
  13.	Once the biomass samples have dried, remove the foil pack from the oven, weigh to nearest mg, and record the sample (including foil) dry mass on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass.
  14.	Review the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in, that numbers have appropriate units specified, that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.
  15.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  16.	After samples have been weighed, and before leaving the lab for the day, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass biomass and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name:  
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “veg”
  - b.	Example:  PM 2016-06-23 veg

### Process samples: Fouling mass
*Goal: Measure fouling load on seagrass leaves, including epiphytes, detritus, and sediment. At the end of this procedure you should have 10 fouling mass samples and 10 associated seagrass leaf samples.*

  1.	Print a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass. Fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as data recorder. Explain any abbreviations used.
  2.	In the lab, carefully transfer contents of the ziploc bag containing the fouling mass sample into a large, shallow sorting tray (white is best).
  3.	Remove any loose unattached macroalgae and sessile macroinvertebrates, if present, from the seagrass.
  4.	Separate seagrass above-ground biomass from any below-ground biomass by cutting the shoot where color changes from green to white/clear. Discard any below-ground material.
  5.	Separate seagrass leaves and arrange them on the flat surface of the tray. Then use a razor blade (preferably plastic) or other edged instrument to gently scrape the length of each leaf to remove attached epiphytes and fouling material. Scrape both sides of each blade, removing all material, including crustose algae if present.
  6.	Prepare a labeled aluminum foil pack or tray for the fouling material for oven drying. Write the label clearly, using a dark sharpie or equivalent, on the foil pack using the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass fouling mass samples above, but with addition of the tare (empty) mass of the foil pack:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fouling” sample number tare
  - b.	Example: AB 2016-03-15 fouling 3, 1.246 g
  7.	Record the sample number and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass.
  8.	Place the scraped fouling material in its labeled aluminum pack.
  9.	Place the labeled foil packs containing the fouling mass samples in the drying oven at ~60°C and dry to constant weight (usually 1-3 days).
  10.	Once the samples have dried, remove the foil pack from the oven, weigh to nearest mg, and record the sample (including foil) dry mass on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass.
  11.	Return to the seagrass leaves in the sample tray. Measure the length and width of each scraped leaf and record on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass.
  12.	Prepare a labeled aluminum foil pack or tray for the scraped seagrass leaves for oven drying. Write the label clearly, using a dark sharpie or equivalent, on the foil pack using the MarineGEO convention for labeling seagrass fouling mass samples above, but with addition of the designation “leaves” and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fouling” sample number, “leaves”, tare
  - b.	Example: AB 2016-03-15 fouling 3, leaves, 1.568 g
  13.	Record the sample number and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass.
  14.	Place the scraped leaves in the labeled aluminum pack.
  15.	Place the labeled foil packs containing the scraped leaves in the drying oven at ~60°C and dry to constant weight (usually 1-3 days).
  16.	Once the samples have dried, remove the foil pack from the oven, weigh to nearest mg, and record the sample (including foil) dry mass on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass.
  17.	Review the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in, that numbers have appropriate units (g or mg, cm or mm) specified, that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.
  18.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  19.	After samples have been weighed, and before leaving the lab for the day, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet for seagrass fouling mass and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name:  
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fouling”
  - b.	Example:  AB 2016-03-15 fouling

### Process samples: Mobile epifauna
*Goal: Preserve a sample of the mobile epifaunal community with data on the macrophytes with which it was associated. At the end of this procedure you should have 10 mobile epifauna samples and 10 associated seagrass samples from which the epifauna were collected.*
  1.	Print a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna. Fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as data recorder. Explain any abbreviations used.
  2.	In the lab, carefully transfer contents of the sample bag containing the mobile epifauna and associated seagrass into a large 0.5 mm-mesh sieve. Rinse the sample bag into the sieve, repeatedly if necessary, to ensure that all material from the sample is on the sieve.
  3.	Rinse the contents of the 0.5 mm sieve under a gentle stream of tap water to remove sediment and small debris from the sample.
  4.	Transfer the seagrass and associated animals from the sieve to a large, shallow sorting tray (white is best) filled with water. Rinse the sieve with a squirt bottle of water, repeatedly if necessary, to ensure that all material from the sample is transferred to the tray.
  5.	When all material has been removed from the sieve, rinse it thoroughly and then assemble a nested pair of sieves, with the 1 mm sieve on top and the 0.5 mm sieve below. This will be used in following steps to concentrate the epifauna.
  6.	Agitate the seagrass material in the tray of water for a minute or so to dislodge associated animals. Then pour the water and dislodged animals into the nested pair of sieves.
  7.	Carefully refill the tray with tap water, repeat the agitation of the seagrass sample, and pour the water with any remaining animals into the paired set of sieves. Repeat this step until few or no animals are left in the agitated water.
  8.	Carefully remove all seagrass, macroalgae, and sessile macroinvertebrates from the tray, checking to ensure that no mobile epifauna are clinging to the removed material. Set the removed material aside to be weighed in a later step.
  9.	Return to the nested pair of sieves, which should now contain all mobile epifauna from the sample.
  10.	Locate two 20-ml scintillation vials (preferably plastic) for storage of the mobile epifauna on the two sieves.
  11.	Carefully label each vial with both (1) an internal label, written firmly with pencil on water-proof paper, and (2) an external label, written with sharpie or, better yet, ethanol-resistant felt-tip pen. Check that the two labels for a given vial are identical and follow the MarineGEO convention for labeling mobile epifauna samples above, but with addition of the sieve size:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number, sieve
  - b.  Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6, 0.5 mm  
  12.	Carefully transfer the contents (mobile animals) of the 1-mm sieve to its appropriate labeled vial. This can be done by picking up the mass of small animals with a spatula or spoon, and transferring to the vial. The use a squirt bottle of water to concentrate remaining animals in the sieve, repeating as necessary. The final residue of animals can be washed carefully into the vial with a squirt bottle.
  13.	Remove as much water from the vial as possible, being careful to avoid removing any animals, then fill the vial about ¾ full with 70% EtOH.
  14.	Check to make sure that both internal and external labels are in place and identical.  
  15.	Repeat the last three steps for the contents of the 0.5-mm sieve.
  16.	In cases where the epifaunal sample is too big to fit in a single 20-ml vial, divide the collected animals into as many vials is necessary. Each vial should be assigned a unique subsample number as follows:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number-subsample number, sieve
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6-1, 0.5 mm  
  17. Record the unique label information of each vial on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna.
  18.	Store the sample in a secure, designated place for later identification and enumeration.  
  19.	Return to the seagrass biomass set aside after epifauna was removed to the sieves.
  20.	Prepare a labeled aluminum foil pack or tray for each species of seagrass, macroalga, or sessile macroinvertebrate for oven drying. Write a label for each clearly, using a dark sharpie or equivalent, on the foil pack using the MarineGEO convention for labeling mobile epifauna samples above, but with addition of the designation “[taxon]” and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack:
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number, “[taxon]”, tare
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6, Zostera, 0.786 g
  21.	Record the sample number and tare (empty) mass of the foil pack on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna.
  22.	Place the biomass of seagrass, macroalga, or sessile invertebrate in its labeled aluminum pack.
  23.	Place the labeled foil packs containing the biomass samples in the drying oven at ~60°C and dry to constant weight (usually 1-3 days).
  24.	Once the samples have dried, remove the foil pack from the oven, weigh to nearest mg, and record the sample (including foil) dry mass on the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna.
  25.	Review the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in, that numbers have appropriate units (g or mg, cm or mm) specified, and that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.  
  26.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  27.	After samples have been weighed, and before leaving the lab for the day, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet for epifauna and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name:  
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) fauna
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna


### Count and identify mobile epifauna
*Goal: Characterize species composition and abundance of mobile epifauna associated with seagrass.*
  1.	Print a blank MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species. Fill in all requested metadata clearly and legibly. Write your full name on the sheet as sample sorter. Explain any abbreviations used. Use a separate data sheet for each of the ten mobile epifauna samples.
  2.	Note: Normal MarineGEO protocol is to enumerate only those epifauna retained on the 1 mm sieve. We also exclude from the mobile epifauna category all primarily meiofaunal taxa, including nematodes, copepods, ostracods, and mites. If these are retained on the sieves they can be ignored.  
  3.	Empty the contents of the 20-ml vial containing the 1-mm sieve epifaunal sample into a 10 cm glass Petri dish or similar vessel for sorting. If the sample is large, begin with a portion of the sample, and repeat until the sample is completed.
  4.	Prepare the sample for photographic measurement of epifaunal body sizes: remove as much debris as possible and spread the animals out so they are separated on the bottom of the dish. If there are too many animals to separate clearly, return some to the vial to clear space.
  5.	Place a centimeter rule under or adjacent to the dish to provide a scale for measurement.
  6.	Take one or more digital photographs to capture all animals in the dish at sufficient resolution that their body sizes can later be measured from the image using the included scale. Photographs may be captured with a camera attached to the microscope or with a cell phone fitted with a macro lens.
  7.	Inspect the images to make sure they are sharp enough to measure body sizes of animals.
  8.	Once all animals in the sample have been photographed, it’s time to identify and count them. If you don't know the taxonomy well (and even if you do), it’s often easiest to separate the animals into groups by morphospecies.  
  9.	Count all individuals of a given (morpho)species. As you count them, remove them to a small vial with 70% ethanol and an internal label with the sample information (as above) and species name. If you cannot reliably identify the taxon to species, identify it to the lowest taxon that you feel confident in, and give it a provisional name, (e.g., Nereid polychaete A).  
  10.	Record the taxon name, provisional or otherwise, and the number of specimens on the MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species.
  11.	Note: Strive to keep as separate taxa that you suspect are different species, even if you don’t know their names. For example, if your sample contains two groups of amphipod specimens that you can't identify but you feel pretty confident are different species, you can call them amphipod A and amphipod B. This is better than lumping them together under “Unknown amphipods”.  
  12.	Note: It is better to be somewhat less precise in your identification (e.g., Amphipod A or Gammarus sp.) than to record an identification that you have significant doubts about (Gammarus mucronatus?). However it is helpful to make a note on the data sheet indicating your educated guess.  
  13.	Using the microscope or cell phone camera, record photographs of species you can't identify at the highest magnification where you can still achieve a sharp image. Label these images with the sample information and provisional species name you assigned on the data sheet.
  14.	Review the MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species. Check to ensure that all requested fields are filled in and that all entries are clear and legible, and that the data recorder’s name is entered in case questions arise.
  15.	If any changes or omissions to the protocol were necessary, be sure to note these clearly in the notes field on the data sheet.
  16.	After the sample has been sorted, and before leaving the lab for the day, scan the MarineGEO standard datasheet – epifaunal species and store both the paper copy and the scanned electronic copy in a secure place designated for this purpose. Use the MarineGEO label convention for the electronic file name but with addition of “counts”:  
  - a.	Convention: Sitecode date (yyyy-mm-dd) “fauna” sample number, sieve, “counts”
  - b.	Example: FP 2016-05-10 fauna 6, 1.0 mm, counts


### Methods: Curate the data

*Goal: Ensure that all field and lab data are accurately recorded, annotated, backed up, distributed to the appropriate parties, and safely archived.*
  1.	Develop the habit of checking data sheets regularly to make sure they are complete, legible, and understandable to someone who was not present when they were filled in (e.g., avoid obscure or non-standard abbreviations, number without units, dates without years, etc). Specifically, check data sheets before leaving the field, and before leaving the lab for the day.
  2.	Store all samples, paper data sheets, electronic copies of data sheets, and images in secure places (physical and virtual) designated for this purpose by your MarineGEO site PI.
  3.	As samples are processed, weighed, and counted, enter the data from the paper data sheets into the MarineGEO standard seagrass community survey data spreadsheet. Always retain the original paper and scanned data sheets, even after data have been entered into the spreadsheet.
  4.	Once field and lab processing of all samples are complete, email the entire package of files (data spreadsheet, scans of all paper data sheets, and any images collected) to MarineGEO HQ at: <marinegeo-data@si.edu>.
