### About this protocol  
Use the "Sampling Event & Environmental Monitoring" protocol to collect appropriate metadata for each sampling locality at least once per field season, and to deploy temperature loggers to track temperature throughout the year. The protocol provides instructions and resources for measuring qualitative and quantitative site characteristics such as coordinates, depth, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen.
