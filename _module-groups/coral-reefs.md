# Background

Coral reefs are both tropical ecosystems and geologic formations. They develop in shallow tropical waters around the calcareous structures built by corals —- colonial cnidarian animals that harbor photosynthesizing algal cells within their bodies. Corals thrive under conditions of high light, stable warm temperatures, clear water, low nutrient supply, and vigorous grazing that removes competing algae. Coral reefs are often referred to as 'rainforests of the sea', harboring diverse communities of all types of organisms. Primary production is dominated by the coral’s symbiotic zooxanthellae and by free-living filamentous algae that form short turfs whose low biomass masks a tight balance between rapid production and intense grazing. Coral reefs are also very important to people. The value of coral reefs has been estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars and perhaps as much as 172 billion U.S. dollars each year, providing food, protection of shorelines, jobs based on tourism, and even medicines. Thriving reefs require a narrow set of environmental conditions that are changing rapidly under human impact. These include warm (but not too warm), clear water low in nutrients, high alkalinity that supports calcification, and often also abundant herbivores. Humans are changing reef ecosystems through fishing and coastal development but the most existential threats to reefs are indirect consequences of the fossil fuel-based global economy: warming sea temperatures and declining alkalinity of seawater.

# Methods

MarineGEO protocols, listed below, provide a standardized set of measurements for characterizing the changing structure and health of coral reef communities, including coeral cover and physical structure, coral demography and disease, and community composition of corals and fishes. The data collected are meant to be inter-comparable with those of other major reef monitoring programs, including the <a href="https://www.icriforum.org/gcrmn">Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN)</a>,  <a href="https://reeflifesurvey.com/">Reef Life Survey</a>, and the <a href="http://www.agrra.org/">Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA)</a>.

Coral reef community sampling has several components: (1) photoquadrat-based measurements of benthic species composition (corals and other sessile organisms) and percent cover; (2) rugosity or structural complexity; and (3) diver visual censuses of fishes. Detailed protocols are provided in the linked modules below.
