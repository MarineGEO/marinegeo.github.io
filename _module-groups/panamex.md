# Purpose

## Objectives

To assess latitudinal patterns in key demographic processes and community interactions, including recruitment, assemblage composition, and the influence of predation pressure on the development of fouling communities.
Settling plates serve as passive collectors for colonization of marine organisms, providing an easy and standardized method to assess the presence of key species and development of benthic communities. With your help, we will carry out a settling plate experiment at a series of locations throughout the Americas representing a (nearly) pole-to-pole latitudinal gradient in Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We will assess changes in assemblage over time (repeated measures) and manipulate predation pressure using exclusion cages.

### Hypotheses

1.	Recruitment, organism growth, and percent cover will increase at a faster rate toward the equator
2.	Assemblage diversity (richness & evenness) will be higher toward the equator
3.	Predation pressure will be more intense, reducing biomass to a greater extent, toward the equator

### Experimental design
At each location, partners will deploy 8 replicates of 4 treatments (32 panels total):
1.	Control (open-panel)
2.	Caged panel
3.	Cage-control (half cage over panel)
4.	Exposed caged panel (panel caged for duration then exposed (open) at the end to observe predator visitation and effect on mature community)

## Materials and Supplies
We will provide essentially all materials for the experimental units. You will also need 20 cored bricks (as weight), a hammer, camera, salinity probe/YSI, weighing scale & basic field stationery.

## Site selection
The experimental units are designed to be deployed by line into the water from a marina or other area with floating pontoons/docks, which are ideally wooden sided (to allow hammering bent-nails into them) and not too high (a few meters or less) from the water. Sites should be at least 2m deep at low tide and marine, with minimal fresh-water influence (>25ppt).  A cumulative dock length of about 80m, from one or multiple sections (or sides), is ideal.

While we seek to use floating docks, we realize that these may not be available at all sites.  If you do not have access to such a site, please contact us to discuss alternatives.

## Time requirements
We plan to ship all materials in late May and would ask you to deploy the experiments at your convenience in June. The units take one person approximately half a day to assemble, and half a day to deploy. Every 2 weeks, the units will need photographing and cleaning, which takes about half a day. The units will be in the water for 12 weeks (6 data points), after which the experiment can be retrieved and broken down (full day).

## Data collection
Most data will be collected as photographs of the panels, which can be uploaded to a Smithsonian DropBox every 2 weeks; the panel photos will be analysed for community composition centrally at the Smithsonian. In addition, we ask that you deploy a HOBO temperature logger (provided) for the duration of the experiment, and record environmental measures (temperature, salinity, turbidity) every 2 weeks. At the end of the experiment, we will ask you to conduct a short-term predation assay and collect observations on predator (especially fish) assemblages.  We also plan to provide materials to preserve the panel communities at end of the experiment for meta-barcoding.

Once we have confirmation, we will send out detailed protocols for the experiments and help address/resolve remaining questions or issues that arise.

## Outcomes

The most immediate outcome from this initial project will be at least one peer-reviewed publication, which will include as co-author the lead researcher from each site.  

We expect to build upon this initial PanAmEx project, conducting additional experiments in future years.  Importantly, participation in this inaugural experiment does not obligate you to participate in future projects.  While we hope you may be interested in further collaboration, each project will constitute an independent assembly of participants and “opt-in” decision.
