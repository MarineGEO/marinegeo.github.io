# Purpose

The Pan-American Experimental Initiative in Marine Macroecology (PanAmEx) is a new experimental network to examine broad-scale ecological patterns and processes across coastal marine ecosystems of North, Central, and South America. Panamex is coordinated and supported by the Smithsonian Institution (including the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and the Smithsonian-led MarineGEO program) and Temple University. The initiative relies on collaboration among a widely distributed network of partner researchers to implement simple (low effort), standardized, and replicated experiments.  

This first PanAmEx project, initiated in 2018 and 2019, is an experiment to assess gradients in interaction strength among nearshore marine organisms, focusing on how predation affects development of communities of fouling organisms. The experment's novelty is its unprecedented scale -- across latitudes nearly from plole to pole along the Americas, in both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  



## Objectives

The Panamex experiment will quantify latitudinal patterns in key demographic processes and community interactions, including recruitment, assemblage composition, and the influence of predation on fouling community development. We use PVC settling plates as passive collectors for colonization of organisms, providing a simple, standardized assessment of key species and benthic community assembly. The experiment uses predator-exclusion cages to test how predation affects communities, and how these effects change across global gradients of temperature and other environmental drivers. With your help, we will answer these questions!

### Hypotheses

1.	Recruitment, organism growth, and percent cover will increase at a faster rate toward the equator.
2.	Assemblage diversity (richness & evenness) will be higher toward the equator.
3.	Predation pressure will be more intense, reducing biomass to a greater extent, toward the equator.

### Experimental design
At each location, partners will deploy 8 replicate units each of 4 treatments (32 panels total):
1.	Control (open-panel, exposed to predators)
2.	Caged panel (protected from predators)
3.	Cage-control (half cage over panel, exposed to predators but also any artifacts of caging)
4.	Exposed caged panel (caged during experiment, then exposed at the end to observe predator feeding)

## Materials and Supplies
We will provide essentially all materials needed for the experimental units. Partmners will need to provide 20 cored bricks (as weight), a hammer, camera, salinity probe/YSI, weighing scale and basic field stationery.

## Site selection
The experimental units are designed to be deployed by line into the water from a marina or other area with floating pontoons/docks, which are ideally wooden-sided (to attach the cages with nails) and not too high (a few meters or less) above the water. Sites should be at least 2m deep at low tide and marine, with minimal fresh-water influence (>25ppt).  A cumulative dock length of about 80m, from one or multiple sections (or sides), is ideal. While we seek to use floating docks, we realize that these may not be available at all sites.  If you do not have access to such a site, we are ahppy to discuss alternatives.

## Time requirements
We shipped materials for the northern hemisphere deployments in May 2018 for deployment in June, northern summer. The units take one person approximately half a day to assemble, and half a day to deploy. Every 2 weeks, each plate needs to be  photographed and the cage assembly cleaned, which takes about half a day. The units will be in the water for 12 weeks, providing 6 data points at 2-week intervals, after which the experiment can be retrieved and broken down (one full day).

## Data collection
Most data will be collected as photographs of the panels, which can be uploaded to a Smithsonian DropBox every 2 weeks; the panel photos will be analysed for community composition centrally at the Smithsonian. In addition, we ask that partners deploy a HOBO temperature logger (provided in the materials kit) for the duration of the experiment, and record environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, turbidity) every 2 weeks. At the end of the experiment, partners will conduct a short-term predation assay and collect observations on predators visiting the units.  We also expect to provide materials to preserve the panel communities at end of the experiment for DNA meta-barcoding.

See the detailed protocol document linked at the top of this page.

## Outcomes

The most immediate outcome from this initial project will be at least one peer-reviewed publication, which will include as co-author the lead researcher from each site.  

We expect to build upon this initial PanAmEx project, conducting additional experiments in future years.  Importantly, participation in this inaugural experiment does not obligate you to participate in future projects.  While we hope you may be interested in further collaboration, each project will constitute an independent assembly of participants and “opt-in” decision.
