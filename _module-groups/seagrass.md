Seagrasses are a group of 72 species of flowering plants that spend their entire lives submerged in seawater. Most seagrasses root in shallow sediment bottoms, where sufficient light penetrates to support growth — generally less than 20 meters depth and in turbid estuaries much shallower. Seagrasses are the foundation of submerged vegetated ecosystems in shallow coastal waters from the equator to high latitudes on all continents except Antarctica. Seagrass meadows are highly productive, provide important habitat for animals, including commercially important fisheries and species of concern, and are important sites of 'blue' carbon storage. Seagrass ecosystems and the services they provide are threatened by a range of interacting human activities, notably coastal development, declining water quality, invasive species, and climate warming. Thus, tracking status and trends in seagass cover and quality is an emerging priority for ocean and coastal management

MarineGEO protocols provide a standardized set of measurements for characterizing the changing structure and health of seagrass communities, including the cover and physical structure of seagrass canopy, fouling load, and community structure of the epifaunal and fish communities that use seagrasses as habitat.

The data collected are comparable to those of other major seagrass monitoring programs, Seagrass Watch (McKenzie et al. 2000) and SeagrassNet (Short et al. 2006).

## Methods

Seagrass community sampling has two main components: (1) non-destructive measurements of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae), percent cover, and shoot density; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass structure, fouling load, and associated epifauna. The assessment is structured around three replicate 50-m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover, species composition, and seagrass shoot density (in a portion of the quadrat if shoots are very dense) are recorded within each of five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). Three types of samples are then collected (N = 15 each) and returned to the lab for processing: (1) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to measure seagrass leaf length and width, sheath length, and mass of fouling material; and (2) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to characterize the associated mobile epifauna community.
