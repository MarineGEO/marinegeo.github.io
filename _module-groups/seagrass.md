Seagrasses are found in shallow salty and brackish waters in many parts of the world, from the tropics to the Arctic Circle. Seagrasses are so-named because most species have long green, grass-like leaves. They are often confused with seaweeds, but are actually more closely related to the flowering plants that you see on land. Seagrasses have roots, stems and leaves, and produce flowers and seeds. They evolved around 100 million years ago, and today there are approximately 72 different seagrass species that belong to four major groups. Seagrasses can form dense underwater meadows, some of which are large enough to be seen from space. Although they often receive little attention, they are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world. Seagrasses provide shelter and food to an incredibly diverse community of animals, from tiny invertebrates to large fish, crabs, turtles, marine mammals and birds. Seagrasses provide many important services to people as well, but many seagrasses meadows have been lost because of human activities. Work is ongoing around the world to restore these important ecosystems.

MarineGEO protocols provide a standardized set of measurements for characterizing the changing structure and health of seagrass communities, including the cover and physical structure of seagrass canopy, fouling load, and community structure of the epifaunal and fish communities that use seagrasses as habitat.

The data collected are comparable to those of other major seagrass monitoring programs, Seagrass Watch (McKenzie et al. 2000) and SeagrassNet (Short et al. 2006).

## Methods

Seagrass community sampling has two main components: (1) non-destructive measurements of plant species composition (seagrass and macroalgae), percent cover, and shoot density; and (2) collection and processing of samples for seagrass structure, fouling load, and associated epifauna. The assessment is structured around three replicate 50-m transects, permanently marked where possible, at each site. Macrophyte percent cover, species composition, and seagrass shoot density (in a portion of the quadrat if shoots are very dense) are recorded within each of five 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats located randomly along each transect (N = 15 quadrats total at the site). Three types of samples are then collected (N = 15 each) and returned to the lab for processing: (1) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to measure seagrass leaf length and width, sheath length, and mass of fouling material; and (2) a bag sample of seagrass shoots to characterize the associated mobile epifauna community.
