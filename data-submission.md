The MarineGEO Data Submission Portal is a web-based application for data submission. [Click here](https://marinegeo.shinyapps.io/data_portal/) to launch the application. 

This application allows you to submit data and metadata to the MarineGEO database. The application will ask you to review and agree to our data authorship and privacy agreement before you are able to submit data. You must upload your data on the MarineGEO spreadsheets included with our protocols. Each file must be an Excel file (the file extension is '.xlsx'). We do not require your files to have a specific naming convention.

Once data is submitted you will receive a report providing feedback on the quality control of your submission. Use the report to make any necessary updates and resubmit the data.
